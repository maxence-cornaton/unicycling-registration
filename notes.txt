Notes from Unicon 2024:
Unicycling Registration Software
- Entering basketball 1st, 2nd, and 3rd placements required extra fields that seemed useless. Would benefit from an update here.
- Personal access to more data in UDA. Some directors should have more access if they are expected to aid other directors
- In general easier access to updating data in UDA would be helpful


Notes from May 24,2014 with Connie:

BBall - Competitior List, Asssign Reg-> Comp, print Comp List with members, Enter Ranked places, Approved Entered data, Lock event, Post Data, Print Awards, Print Labels, Mark Labels done.

Individual - Show by Age Group, Age Group Management (needs love), randomize competitor order, manual competitor re-order, Add/Manage judges, list/print judges,  olck results, awards print, awards labels, awards done, post

Pairs/Group, same as above, with 2-medals occurring

MUni CC-Beginner - Manage Age Groups, Post Competitors by Age Group, Enter start times, with the same start time for many people, see competitors without data and data without competitors before "approving (importing)" the data. awards....

10k - Print/export registrant data with Best Time (for use by chief judge when creating start-lists).

100m - Show by age group, line up referee show lane assignments, ref can DNS/DQ/Reason/who-is-dq-er, import action should only allow if it matches the heat data. Import action without approval results in all heat entries having data (due to DNS/DNF/DQ), Print/display/results by age group, for showing to competitors (Include a flag/action which triggers notification/PDF?), lock (no more inputs), see data by heat (admin-only).



=== below this line is PRE-may-24-2014.
- Adjust the Advanced XC data by 2 minutes (they started later.

POST-NAUCC2013 Report/Requests:

- Personalized Schedule, Page 2 of the registration package
 - Awesome feature: include the full convention schedule, highlighting the events that the registrant is signed up for.
 - Includes all competition events, and ONLY competition events.

 - Make PDFs of the results available for PUBLIC consumption.
  - Make personalized results pages available for each competitor.

 - Make the Overall Champion calculation part of UDA.
  - Track: ties are resolved by the number of 1sts, then by place of 100m. Points: 8,6,4,2,1
  - MUni: (at nationals, only) 3 events, and ties are resolved by number of 1sts, then number of 2nds, then 3rd places, 4th places, 5th, and then by Cross-country.
  - Distance: Each event has X points for 1st through 10th. Ties are resolved by number of 1sts, 2nds, thirds, fourths, fifths, then by Marthon.
  - Be able to publish the resuts of the calculation during the week (before all the events have been competed).

- Improve the flow of the High/Long recordincg, to better match the way that they run the event.
- DNF should be possible.

 THINGS to fix:
 - Give people 4 safety pins.
 UPS Backups for the Router.

=================================

Connie Wants:
- Registration system which tracks when someone has picked up their registration package?
 - Flag people who have not picked up their registration package.
 - Be able to search for a registrant, and mark that they are picked up.
 - Indicate any registrants who have not picked up their registration packet (on their name?)
- Mark people who have not paid as special (perhaps by adjusting their name?)
 - On the Race Sign up forms, indicate that these people are not likely to show up.....maybe don't put them on the list until they are paid too.
 - Not even on the "eligible" list for race sign-ups.

 - Default sort order for AgeGroupEntry.

Denis:
- Treats the sign-in as a sign-up.
- Where do I provide e-mail my e-mail address
- "What am I doing on the t-shirt page"?

Connie:
- Why is the address below the events
- Can we add "levels" to the Indiviudal/Pairs categores
- Validate the age of competitors for Individual freestyle categores?

-------------

TODO (flesh out and implement)
BestTimeType:
- Name
- Description
- Initial Value
- Increment step(s)?

To Be answered by the Event Organizers:

Check that the placeholder text works in other browsers, or add jquery fix for it?
 - add http://selectivizr.com/ ??
CSS Reset?
smidget?

Try different ways of displaying the Event Catgories.
Add Tests for when a configuration doesn't exist yet (ensure the site loads/etc)

For Nan:
- Registration Periods should have unique expense items (so that we can directly match a payment) (ie. No two registration periods should have the same expense items)
- Registration Preidos should also have unique items between comp and non-comp
